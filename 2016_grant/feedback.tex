\subsection{Feedback IRL}
\label{sec:feedback}

To complement the new computational model we put forth, the new
technology that we plan to develop as part of this proposal is a new
model of IRL, and accompanying algorithms, which allows for both
positive and negative (not necessarily binary) labels, and, moreover,
which also allows for partial feedback, meaning subtrajectories (i.e.,
options~\cite{sutton99}) can be ascribed such labels.
