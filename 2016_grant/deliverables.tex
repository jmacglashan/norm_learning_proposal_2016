\section{Deliverables}

The proposed project includes the following deliverables: 

\begin{enumerate}

\item An {\em experimental platform\/} in which humans can interact
  with artificial agents, thereby providing a space for
  artificial agents to demonstrate their capacity to represent, learn,
  and apply cooperative behaviors in context-appropriate ways.

\item {\em Software infrastructure for learning together with
  machine-learning algorithms\/} that enable the representation,
  learning, and application of cooperative behaviors in simulated
  stochastic games.
  Code will be made available as a part of the Brown-UMBC
  Reinforcement Learning and Planning
  library\footnote{http://burlap.cs.brown.edu}.

\item Data comprised of the behaviors produced by both humans and
  machines in stochastic games, under varying conditions of complexity
  and uncertainty, as well empirical evaluations of those behaviors.
  These data will form a set of {\em computational benchmarks}, which
  other researchers can freely use to evaluate their own computational
  approaches. 

\item Syllabus for an undergraduate class on ``Social autonomous
  driving'' in which students learn to endow autonomous driving
  vehicles with the ability to represent, learn, and apply
  expectations for cooperative driving.

\end{enumerate}

In year two, we will organize a workshop on the machine learning of
socially rational behavior. Such a gathering is timely, as a number of
subareas are grappling with related problems. We will include
researchers in human--robot collaboration~\cite{gopalan15}, intelligent
software, end-user programming of household devices~\cite{ur14},
agent-based bidding~\cite{tac:book}, multi-agent reinforcement
learning~\cite{sodomka13}, computational social
cognition~\cite{baker14}, and others.
