\paragraph{Deliverables}

The proposed project includes the following deliverables: 

\begin{enumerate}

\item An {\em experimental platform\/} in which humans can interact
  with artificial agents, thereby providing a space for artificial
  agents in general, and our socially rational agents, specifically to
  demonstrate their capacity to represent, learn, and apply
  collaborative behaviors. % in context-appropriate ways.

\item {\em Software infrastructure for socially rational algorithm
  development and experimentation\/} made available as a part of the Brown--UMBC
  Reinforcement Learning and Planning library.\footnote{The open
  source Brown--UMBC Reinforcement Learning and   
  Planning (BURLAP) library (\url{http://burlap.cs.brown.edu}) is the
  software infrastructure that will be used for algorithm development
  in this project.  Developed by James MacGlashan under the direction
  of co-PI Littman, the system provides a flexible and powerful
  implementation of a wide variety of reinforcement-learning
  algorithms and environments, and has been extensively used in both
  published research and education (including in a
  reinforcement-learning MOOC).  The algorithm that formed the basis
  of the experiments in this proposal (RHCIRL) is available as
  part of the BURLAP distribution.}

\item Data comprised of the behaviors produced by both humans and
  machines on a test bed of stochastic games, varying the degrees of
  complexity and uncertainty, as well evaluations of those behaviors,
  available as a {\em socially rational benchmark}.
% , which other researchers will be free to
%   use to evaluate their own approaches to collaborative learning.

\item {\em Syllabus for an undergraduate class} on ``Social autonomous
  driving'' in which students develop socially rational driving
  algorithms for robot cars.

\end{enumerate}

In Year~2, we plan to organize a workshop (e.g., a AAAI symposium)
on the machine learning of socially rational behavior. Such a
gathering would be timely, as a number of subareas are grappling with
related problems. We will include researchers in human--robot
collaboration~\cite{gopalan15}, self-driving
cars~\cite{dolgov2010path}, end-user programming of household
devices~\cite{ur14}, agent-based bidding~\cite{tac:book}, multi-agent
reinforcement learning~\cite{sodomka13}, computational social
cognition~\cite{baker14}, and others.
