\paragraph{Broader Impact}

The many devices in our world that collect and share data among
the ever-growing ``Internet of Things"
cannot yet intelligently coordinate their actions to carry out complex
tasks without extensive human programming and configuration.  As this
collection of devices grows, and begins to include more traditional
robotic actors and more sophisticated software agents, the need for
these entities to not just communicate but work collaboratively is
only going to increase.  We will want and need them to work together
with and without us to accomplish everyday tasks and help us make
better decisions.

The range of domains that would be positively impacted by machines
that can collaborate effectively with humans and support human
decision-making is endless, ranging from robotic sous chefs to
gerontechnological support for aging in place, to name two.

In an effort to increase diversity in computer science, we have
pre-selected two graduate students to participate in this
project---one woman, and the other Hispanic.  All students (both
graduate and undergraduate) who join our team will learn the benefits
of collaboration with cognitive psychologists on our team.  Specifically, they will
strengthen their understanding of a number of fields, all of which are
critical to the development of artificial agents that collaborate
effectively with humans: e.g., behavioral economics, cognitive
psychology, reinforcement learning, software engineering, etc..
We also plan to integrate our work on this project into Artemis, a
free summer program that introduces rising 9th grade girls to
computational thinking.
For example, we might have the Artemis girls teach a robot to
collaborate with them on various tasks, such as navigation or object search.

Our deliverables include an open-source publicly accessible toolkit for machine norm learning via reinforcement learning. Further, we will build a database of machine-machine, human-machine, and human-human experimental results on norm-learning problems, which can serve as a benchmark for future researchers to build artifical agents that increasingly achieve human-like behavior.

Finally, we expect to publish the results of the proposed research in
top-tier archival, conference proceedings and journals with high
impact factors, and present our work at both computer science and
psychology conferences.
