\commenta{two platforms: BURLAP; MTurk}

The open source Brown-UMBC Reinforcement Learning and Planning (BURLAP) library is the software infrastructure used for algorithm development in this project. Developed by James MacGlashan under the direction of co-PI Littman, the system provides a flexible and powerful implementation of a wide variety of reinforcement-learning-related approaches and has been extensively in both published research and education (including a widely used reinforcement-learning MOOC). The gradient-based inverse reinforcement-learning algorithm MLIRL is the basis for the work we describe in this proposal and it is available as part of the BURLAP distribution.

Following the preliminary work described in this proposal, human-subject experiments will be conducted on the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform.
