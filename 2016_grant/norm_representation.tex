\label{sec:models}

As grid games are examples of stochastic
games~\cite{Fink64,Shapley53}, we use this game-theoretic
framework to model agent interactions.
%
Like econometricians~\cite{RePEc:eee:ecochp:6a-64}, we assume a
structural form for utility functions; and because we are interested
in building socially rational artificial agents, we endow our agents
with a (potentially) social utility function.
%
We then develop a batch learning algorithm by which an artificial
agent can, by learning from demonstrations, recover a social utility
function that supports exactly one of many equilibria (assuming the
demonstrations exhibit exactly one of many equilibria).
%
We also develop an interactive learning algorithm by which two agents
can simultaneously learn a social utility function, and converge
%(very quickly)
to one among a plethora of equilibria, thereby endogenously solving
the equilibrium selection-process.

Both of these algorithms rely on IRL, and in our experiments thus far
they invoke only standard IRL (e.g.,~\cite{MLIRL, BIRL}).
As standard IRL cannot accommodate negative feedback,
