\section{Broader Impacts}

Recent trends in computer science and artificial intelligence are
moving us toward increasing dependence on human--computer
collaborative systems in which people and software each make decisions
that impact one another. Some fields, such as human--computer
interaction (HCI), focus on systems in which a human being is
primarily in control and the computer's decisions are assessed in
terms of the positive impact they have on the user. An interesting
recent example is Centaur
chess\footnote{http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-cassidy/centaur-chess-shows-power_b_6383606.html}
in which a human and machine team up to play on the same side in
chess, both making decisions, but with the machine acting as an
advisor and the human deciding which moves to actually make. Other
fields, like crowd sourcing human computation~\cite{von2009human},
combine human and machine expertise such that the machine is the
ultimate arbiter of behavior and a group of human beings act as lower
level computational components.

True collaboration, however, does not start with one participant being
assigned to a leadership role. Instead, the various agents need to
dynamically negotiate their roles and jockey for position, discovering
when and how to trust each other to move forward. A concrete example
is in the context of self-driving cars. Cars share the road with each
other and must carefully choose when to be responsive to other
vehicles and when to assert themselves to create a situation that
benefits them. Doing so makes a significant difference in the driving's
effectiveness~\cite{cunningham2015mpdm}. A related problem arises when
a self-driving wheelchair attempts to move through a group of
pedestrians~\cite{kim2016socially}. More generally, robots that
interact with people in the physical world need to navigate the
complex give-and-take of establishing mutually beneficial behaviors
where possible.

Thus, a wide variety of human--machine interaction problems would be
positively impacted by the technology we are proposing, such as
robotic sous chefs and gerontechnological support for aging in place.
As such, the project is synergistic with the main efforts of Brown
University's Humanity Centered Robotics Initiative (HCRI), of which
co-PI Littman is co-director. Specifically, within HCRI, there are
ongoing efforts to design robotic systems that interact with people
and support independent living tasks. For an elderly person to trust
and collaborate on tasks with a machine effectively, the machine must
act in a manner that the elderly person expects. This project creates
the foundation for these important applications.

The most direct application of our ideas are in scenarios in which a
robotic agent is sharing a space with bystanders who do not
necessarily share its goals---a personal grocery-store assistant, a
socially aware vacuum, an automated hospital linen cart, a package delivery
drone. To further develop this setting,
% in year 3 
we will
% team up with George and/or Stefanie to do a
build a ``go fetch'' application on a mobile-manipulation platform in
the department.
%  By then, there will be robots in the
% department that can both move and move things around. A 
% robot will need to deal several issues that are directly relevant to
% our project:
It will use its abilities for representing, learning, and applying
cooperative behavior in three separate spheres:
\begin{itemize}
\item navigating smoothly through the atrium and hallways, finding
  appropriate ways to avoid collisions and adopting regularities that
  make it easy for people to coordinate with it quickly;
\item riding in the elevator, which brings with it some related but
  distinct expectations for coordinating (moving in and out of the
  doors, standing inside, asking for help with the buttons, deciding
  what to do when obstructed;
\item understanding how to best signal a handoff of the object it is
  fetching by interrupting people without being too timid or too
  boorish.
\end{itemize}
% This task, while not necessarily the most  is within our technological limitations (unlike wheelchairs
% or actual cars) and would definitely result in some impact if our
% algorithms were able to help.

Interest in robotics and machine learning are growing in the Brown CS
department and we are designing a new robotics introductory sequence
that includes classes on basic robotics algorithms, hardware design,
and human-centered evaluation of robotics systems. As part of this
project, we will offer a new intermediate robotics course called
``Social autonomous driving'' for undergraduates. It will build on the
structure of the Duckietown
platform\footnote{http://duckietown.mit.edu/} from MIT. The emphasis
of the class will be on developing robots that drive around a test
environment, interacting smoothly with other robots and remote
controlled cars, and using socially rational algorithms to adapt to
local ``customs'' and driving styles (such as the ``Pittsburgh left''
or the ``Boston rotary'').

% In an effort to increase diversity in computer science, we have
% pre-selected two graduate students to participate in this
% project---one woman, and the other Hispanic.  All students (both
% graduate and undergraduate) who join our team will benefit from
% collaborating with the cognitive psychologists on our team.
% Specifically, they will strengthen their understanding of a number of
% fields, all of which are critical to the development of artificial
% agents that collaborate effectively with humans: e.g., behavioral
% economics, cognitive psychology, reinforcement learning, and software
% engineering.

The co-PIs have a strong record of mentoring students from
underrepresented groups. In the context of the current work, we plan
to integrate our work on this project into Artemis, a free summer
program run at Brown and directed by PI Greenwald that introduces
rising 9th grade girls to computational thinking.
%\commentj{Explicit mention that this is a STEM priority?}  
For example, we might have the Artemis girls teach a robot to
collaborate with them on various tasks, such as finding and navigating
to common household objects.
%folding laundry.
%\commenta{insert a different example!!!}
%\commenta{You know, girls should be doing housework.} 
% JLA: yeah, i was concerned about the folding laundry example for that reason... 

% Our deliverables include an open-source publicly accessible toolkit
% for agents to learn collaborative behavior via reinforcement
% learning. Further, we will build a database of machine-machine,
% human-machine, and human-human experimental results on
% collaborative-learning problems, which can serve as a benchmark for
% future researchers to build artifical agents that increasingly achieve
% human-like behavior.

Finally, we expect to publish the results of the proposed research in
top-tier archival, conference proceedings and journals with high
impact factors, and present our work at academic conferences.
