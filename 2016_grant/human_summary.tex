\paragraph{Turk Experiments}
\label{sec:human}

We also conducted analogous experiments with humans playing grid games
on Mechanical Turk~\cite{}.

The results involving human subjects playing grid games are consistent
with the results obtained in our simulations of \Q-learners playing
grid games.  In both sets of experiments, more cooperation was
achieved when the treatment incorporated social preferences.  While
the subjective utility functions of artificial agents are within our
control, so that we can perhaps lead artificial agents towards
collaborative behavior, the subjective utility functions of humans are
not.  Nonetheless, behavioral economists often infer approximations of
utility functions from experimental data by assuming some underlying
structural form, and then estimating the relevant
parameters~\cite{blanco11,fisman07}.\commenta{CHECK REFERENCES!}  Likewise, one of the primary
intended uses of our Turk experimental framework is to generate trace
data of humans playing grid games and learning collaborative behavior
(such as trust, CD, etc.), so that we can then proceed to infer
utility functions and relate them back to the behaviors they produce.
