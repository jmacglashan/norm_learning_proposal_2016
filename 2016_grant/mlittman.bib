                 information retrieval that attempts to model the
                 underlying structure of term associations by
                 transforming the traditional representation of
                 documents as vectors of weighted term frequencies to a
                 new coordinate space where both documents and terms are
                 represented as linear combinations of underlying
                 semantic factors. In previous research, LSI has
                 produced a small improvement in retrieval performance.
                 In this paper, we apply LSI to the routing task, which
                 operates under the assumption that a sample of relevant
                 and non-relevant documents is available to use in
                 constructing the query. Once again, LSI slightly
                 improves performance. However, when LSI is used is
                 conduction with statistical classification, there is a
                 dramatic improvement in performance."
