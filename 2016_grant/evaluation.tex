We will evaluate our approach in multiple ways. First, we will test our interactive learning algorithm with other human players in our experimental testbed and compare how often and quickly humans are able to arrive at coordinated plan with our artificial agent versus other humans. To test the expressiveness of our algorithms space of learnable solutions, we will also evaluate how many different kinds of strategies can be found when players play with our agent and compare that to the set of strategies that can be found by humans playing with each other. Subjective evaluations from the human participants will be used to assess whether interacting with the agent feels natural. 

For the batch learning algorithm, we will develop new quantitative metrics to assess behavior similarity so that trajectories produced from the batch learning can be quantitatively compared to the actual human participants. Additionally, using our experimental test bed, we will have two humans interact for a number of sessions and then, without notification to the users, swap out their partner with an artificial agent trained from the history of interactions they had with their human partner. At the end of all interactions, we will ask the user whether they thought they were playing with the same partner the whole time or if their partner switched. Their subjective response to whether they thought their partner was switched at any point will be compared to their subjective response when their partner is swapped out with an artificial agent that did not perform any learning and when their partner is swapped with a different human player.

Finally, we are also interested in norms generalizing to new state spaces. Using our environmental testbed, we will have participants play in a sequence of different grids and using the same kinds of evaluations listed above, test whether our algorithm can safely generalize to new grids as well as other humans can.
