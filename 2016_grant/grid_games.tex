\label{sec:grid_games}

A grid game is a game played by two agents on a grid, in which each
agent has a goal.  See, for example, Figure~\ref{fig:hallway}, which
is a $3\times 5$ grid in which the two agents' initial positions are one
another's goals: Orange begins in position (1,2), Blue's goal; and
Blue begins in position (5,2), Orange's goal.  We refer to grid
positions using $x$-$y$ coordinates, with $(1,1)$ as the bottom left
position.

One grid game proceeds in rounds,
%(20, in our human experiments), 
each round consisting of multiple turns.
%(100, in our human experiments).
On each turn, the agents choose one of five actions (N, S, E, W, or wait),
%north, south, east, west, or wait
which are then executed simultaneously.  In the most basic setup,
agents transition deterministically, and there is no tie-breaking when
two agents collide.%
\footnote{It is a simple matter to vary these rules within our
  infrastructure, as future experimental design might dictate.}
%
Instead, if their chosen actions would result in a collision with one
another, neither agent moves.  A round ends when either (or both)
players move into their goal, or when a maximum number of turns has
been taken.

We present five two-agent grid games, specifically designed to
%prevent the agents from reaching their goals without coordinating their behavior.
vary the level of coordination required.
The games also vary in whether it is possible to adopt a strategy that
allows agents to defend against uncooperative partners---this is a
property that we found to significantly impact the behavior of
reinforcement-learning algorithms.
%
% Consequently, if we assume
% %(as is standard)
% positive step costs, all the equilibria in our games involve mixed
% strategies (because any deterministic strategy either involves butting
% heads indefinitely, or can be exploited).  Since game theorists
% question the validity of mixed strategies as a reasonable model of
% human behavior~\cite{}, we assume zero step costs.  However, this
% assumption has the undesirable effect of rendering all strategy
% profiles in which both agents arrive at their goals simultaneously as
% equilibria, including purely cooperative strategies.
% 
% In reality, 
In these games, one approach is for an agent to cooperate blindly with
its opponent by simply moving out of the opponent's way, and hoping
the opponent then waits for the agent to catch up.  However, such
strategies can be exploited by uncooperative ones that proceed
directly to the goal as soon as their path is unobstructed.
%(because step costs are never truly zero). 
 
To distinguish ``unsafe'' from ``safe'' cooperation, we devised a new
categorization for strategies in our grid games.  We call strategies
that allow for cooperation, while at the same time maintain a
defensive position in the event that the other agent is uncooperative,
\mydef{cooperative defensive} strategies.  More formally, an agent's
strategy is \mydef{cooperative} (C) if it is one that allows both it
and its opponent to reach their goals, while an agent's strategy is
\mydef{defensive} (D) if its opponent does not have a strategy that
allows it to reach its goal strictly first.  A cooperative defensive
(CD) strategy is both cooperative and defensive.
We next apply these concepts to our games to illustrate the kinds
of interactions we plan to study.

Our first example, Hallway, is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:hallway}.
This game is one in which the agents can choose to coordinate, for
example, if both agents agree upon a joint strategy where one agent
moves along the top row and the other along the bottom, without
interfering with one another.  But, an agent could choose to ``defect''
from this joint strategy by proceeding straight to its goal.  There
are CD strategies, however, which defend against such non-cooperative
behavior.
%
For example, if Orange moves south initially to $(1,3)$ and Blue moves
west to $(4,2)$, Orange might choose to return and remain on its goal
until Blue retreats to $(4,3)$ or $(4,1)$, at which point the players
are equidistant from their goals, and both can reach them safely.
This joint strategy is an equilibrium comprised of CD strategies,
since Orange and Blue both remain in positions where they have the
ability to block their opponents until they both have unobstructed
equidistant paths to their respective goals.

%Another defensive strategy for Orange from $(1,3)$ would have it
%proceed east to $(2,3)$, and then choose to move south to $(2,2)$.  If
%Blue is in $(3,2)$ and attempts to move west into $(2,2$), the agents
%would collide until one agent chooses a different action. It is in
%Orange's best interest to continue choosing south to try to take
%$(2,2)$ until Blue surrenders and chooses to go north into $(3,3)$ or
%south into $(3,1)$ to avoid further collision.  At this point, the
%agents are equidistant from their goals, and both can reach them
%safely---hence, we have another equilibrium comprised of CD strategies.

\end{figure}

The grid in Figure~\ref{fig:intersection} (Intersection) requires Blue
to defend against the possibility of Orange behaving uncooperatively,
which it can achieve by squatting on the orange goal until the agents are equidistant from their goals.  
% Orange can then
% move to $(3,1)$ where both agents are equidistant from their goals.
Therefore, like Hallway, this game has an equilibrium comprised of CD strategies
for both players. However, this equilibrium is not the shortest path
and purely cooperative agents in this game could adopt a more
efficient joint strategy.

Figure~\ref{fig:door} (Door) is a grid that requires coordination to
navigate through the narrow center space at $(3,2)$. Several joint CD
strategies exist, but they must be asymmetric because only one agent
can be in the center cell at a time. Similarly, in the grid in
Figure~\ref{fig:longhallway} (Long hall), Blue begins one step closer
to its goal than Orange does.  However, Orange can squat on the blue
goal until Blue chooses to cooperate by taking one step back creating
a joint CD strategy. In contrast, our last grid, shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:nocompromise} (No compromise), does not support joint
CD strategies. Therefore, a trust spanning multiple rounds is required
for the agents to effectively cooperate in this game.

% segue
Taking these five grid games as an initial testbed, we performed two
pilot studies: the first involved simulations of artificial agents
playing against one another; the second pitted humans against other
humans on Mechanical Turk~\cite{austerweil16}.  We summarize the
results of these preliminary studies next.
